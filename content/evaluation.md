## Evaluation
{:#evaluation}

A user study was conducted to evaluate the perception of users.
The participants were asked to use the FormGenerator and FormRenderer apps to create and fill out forms.
Users were provided with a scenario explaining what they were supposed to do.

The feedback received from these users was that the FormGenerator app was easy to use, especially because of the drag-and-drop functionality.
However, the feedback also showed that bindings and other Linked Data concepts still confuse users.
Overall, the feedback on the FormGenerator app was positive and 6 out of the 8 technically proficient users were able to create the form without any issues besides the difficulties with the bindings.

The feedback that was received for the FormRenderer app from all the 11 users, with and without a technical background, was that the app is straightforward to use, easy to use, and clear.
They were all able to fill out the form without any issues.
Besides some minor remarks, the users did not notice that the app was using Solid and Linked Data behind the scenes and this is exactly the goal of the FormRenderer app.
People were also unaware that schema alignment tasks were being performed behind the scenes.
